WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'chipscope_ila_mmc_bd' for IP 'ILA
   (ChipScope Pro - Integrated Logic Analyzer) v1.05.a' was generated with a
   different version of the IP than is currently in the IP Catalog. It was
   originally generated using IP with the packaged timestamp '2013-03-26+22:44';
   the IP in the current catalog has a different packaged timestamp
   '2012-12-18+02:47'. This mismatch is due to changes made to the IP in the
   user repositories. It may affect some functionality of the IP, if there are
   differences between these two versions of the IP.
